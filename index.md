I am a computer science major at CUSF and I will graduate in 2028 and land a good job through networking and consistent studying of code and the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 


* Lab 3 part 1
This lab involved creating a Basal Metabolic Rate. I found this lab one of my favorites as it helped me understand the more basic concepts when learning C++. These basic concepts included how std::couts works and how we can replace a specific word within the cout to get a specific statement. In this case, the variable “BMR” with a number value. I also believe this lab is overall very useful in general since it calculates the calorie intake we should aim for, something everyone should prioritize and acknowledge.
* Lab 4  part 2
This lab was about coding the Hi-Lo guessing game. This lab stood out to me as it shows how easy it is to create a small minigame to pass the time with friends. It involves using if statements and determining whether player 2 inputted the correct variable that player one inputted with their own variable. I like to think this type of game could also come into many other great uses, such as creating a password system in order to open a certain file, where the admin can enter a permanent secret string (assuming the password has variables and integers). Another great use can be to fill in the blank statements for quizzes, just as long as the user types the answer correctly!
* Lab 6 part 2 
This lab took one of the most classic card games into code, making it my favorite lab. Blackjack was fun, especially the one remade for New Super Mario Bros on the Nintendo DS. Coding this involves giving values to several arguments based on the card. For those starting out, the cards with their number value were self-explanatory, but the king, ace, and queen may be a little more complicated. Through most of the code, the bool data type was best used to identify whether you score higher than 21 (bust).
